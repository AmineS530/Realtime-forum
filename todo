the structure i have in mind is something similar to what facebook looks like, we'd have everything displayed at once, but the messages we can make a drop down to show the chat and sent a message, maybe if we get too deep have a message section to show u the message history with all the users etc

-- redirect to mainpage when facing an error or implement 404 page

-- add dropdown for logout and maybe profile
-- error page in SPA WAY*****
------------------------------------
    also type in here when you change something for summary to know what new | i changed the makefile to only ignore the .exec when using make and make it run instantly for now, will see if we need docker later
